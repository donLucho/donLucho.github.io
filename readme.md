# Github IS my CV.
Hi. Welcome. I am glad you're here. I&rsquo;m Luis. This is a group of files I curated during the month of March AND April 2017. I put it together with my Linux operating system and I am especially happy, too. 


## Please visit
You can see [the project](https://donLucho.github.io/ "the project at github") for yourself and decide whether it is really for you or not.

Utility. Speed. Time. Money. Barring the obligatory constraints, I merely am doing my part to be worth my salt.


### Some Personal Goals
Javascript developers are like contractors that build homes. Each is capable of producing a lot of scraps or kruft. Only the best of the contractors whether they are plumbers, roofers, carpenters, etc. will pick up after themselves. The same goes for successful javascript programmers. In the context of javascript, if I create an object I relish the opportunity to destroy it, too, so that javascript V8 engines make better use of its own utilities and resources. 


#### Discovery and other ideas for real world situations
I will be the first to say it!  This project is a prime candidate for the picture element. In practical terms, however, it will be revisited whenever possible so that I am serving image assets other than those that 640px wide by 480px height.
