			<p id="podium">	My name is Luis Artavia. I work in front&#45;end web&#45;development and I am in search of a position in the digital design industry or information technology sector. I have solid experience in developing hand-coded works composed of HTML5, CSS3 media queries and JavaScript with feature-testing. </p>

					<p id="penToPaper">If you believe we share common ground and think that I can help you with your web&#45;development needs &amp; would like to know more, contact me, preferably, at <a id="aintgonnahappen" href="mailto:donluchodev@outlook.com" target="_self">the Outlook address</a> listed on my CV&#45;&#45; curriculum vitae &#45;&#45; that you have in hand. There is a good probability that I am not meant to receive messages from any other email address than the one listed in my r&eacute;sum&eacute;. </p>

				<h3><a href="#menu1" class="menuItem">About me</a></h3>
				<section id="menu1">
					<p class="pennies">I am looking for employment. And, while I am refactoring existing code and changing file extensions (a daunting challenge for any front&#45;end developer a\k\a Javascript developer a\k\a UI developer) I do my best to stay positive. However, I am not the type of person to stroke their own ego and it can be a little more difficult for me to talk more about myself. But, I will give it a go!</p>

					<p class="pennies">I bring two (2) years of relevant corporate experience building UX designs and composing responsive, clean, extensible user interfaces based on PSD or PNG artwork in addition to having ten (10) years of experience in quality-based, fast-turnaround financial service environments. The former does not include the additional seven (7) years personal experience and expertise with Creative Suite and digital asset editing&#45; ditto for AJAX request handling for use with Javascript &amp; PHP. Thus, as of April 2017 I will have been a web&#45;developer for about nine (9) years! Whatever the case, I believe the web becomes a better place when we all learn from one another regardless of title. </p>

					<p class="pennies">Some of my target companies include small to medium&#45;sized graphic design firms. And, if you are aware of any opportunity or know anybody who could accomodate such a request I would appreciate you sharing that information. Some of my peers in school and work have said I am &quot;the gas that runs the car&quot; and I have proved it. Any of my prior bosses worth their salt would have to attest to that to be so. I can contribute to your continuing growth and profits&#45;&#45; bar none! I have implemented a new creative work, too, thanks to the nice people at GitHub. GitHub is presently my only digital playground. My focus is on showing true&#45;substance rather than getting occupied over superficial issues. Expressive, airtight and lightweight code is not done by accident. </p>
					
					<p class="pennies">My short&#45;term goals are a work in progress. For example, recently I completed the CISCO Academy IT Essentials course as of March 2017 but I am not poised for more at the moment. My first priority is to find work and not leave that decision to others. In the near future, I will take the entrance exam for admittance to the local university for sessions commencing in January 2018 &#45; the beginning of next year, in other words. I would like to, Lord willing, obtain a Bachelor&rsquo;s of Science in Information Technology. The admissions exam is set for later this year. </p>

					<p id="progression">For the previous five (5) years, I have been an unemployed full stack web developer striving to improve and refine an ever growing skillset on a daily basis. I am no slouch! I have been practicing skills in front&#45;end development with the exception of the period from October 15, 2015 to December 5, 2016 while side tracked with career choices at a call&#45;centre not related to web development. But you are probably here to see new experiences. Without further delay here is a curated list of previous curiosities, improvements, and experiments for your enjoyment. </p>

					<p id="pulsations">I want to thank you for your visit today. These are items that are close to my heart. Here, you will find the life lessons I have learned and applied throughout my career. By its own definition, it could be accurate to say that what I say and do eventually reflects on a public image that is perceived. You may ask how I got from point A to point B. But in actuality, I insist that you read on but I forewarn you that my transition to point B will not be addressed. I only want to remain positive by focusing on the work and so I can address how my knowledge can be of benefit to a prospective future employer. Ultimately, we each are known for our fruit when we have opportunities to help and benefit others. </p> <!-- -p#pulsations -->
